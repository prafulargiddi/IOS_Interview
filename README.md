1. How is a dictionary different from an array?

A dictionary and an array are both data structures in programming, but they differ in their fundamental properties and usage.
An array is a collection of values of the same type that are stored sequentially in memory. The values in an array can be accessed using an index, which is a numeric value that represents the position of the value in the array. Arrays are often used to store a list of similar items, such as a list of numbers or strings.
A dictionary, on the other hand, is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key in the dictionary is associated with a corresponding value, and the keys and values can be of different data types. Dictionaries are often used to store information in a way that allows for quick and efficient lookups based on a key. For example, a dictionary could be used to store a list of user profiles, where each user is represented by a key and the corresponding value contains the user's information.
In summary, the main differences between a dictionary and an array are:
In an array, values are accessed by index, whereas in a dictionary, values are accessed by key.
Arrays store a collection of values of the same type, while dictionaries store a collection of key-value pairs.
Arrays are often used to store a list of similar items, while dictionaries are used to store information that can be looked up quickly based on a key.
